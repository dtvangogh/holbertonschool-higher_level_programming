# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
## Description
 This project is part of Foundations - Higher-level programming ― Python:
## Project tasks :wrench:

### [0. Print a list of integers mandatory](./0-print_list_integer.py) 
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
### [1. Secure access to an element in a list mandatory](./1-element_at.py) 
* Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
### [2. Replace element mandatory](./2-replace_in_list.py) 
* Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
### [3. Print a list of integers... in reverse! mandatory](./3-print_reversed_list_integer.py) 
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
### [4. Replace in a copy mandatory](./4-new_in_list.py) 
* Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
### [5. Can you C me now? mandatory](./5-no_c.py) 
* Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
### [6. Lists of lists = Matrix mandatory](./6-print_matrix_integer.py) 
* Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
### [7. Tuples addition mandatory](./7-add_tuple.py) 
* Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
### [8. More returns! mandatory](./8-multiple_returns.py) 
* Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
### [9. Find the max mandatory](./9-max_integer.py) 
* Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
### [10. Only by 2 mandatory](./10-divisible_by_2.py) 
* Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
### [11. Delete at mandatory](./11-delete_at.py) 
* Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
### [12. Switch mandatory](./12-switch.py) 
* Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
### [13. Linked list palindrome mandatory](./100-print_python_list_info.c) 
* Technical interview preparation:
### [14. CPython #0: Python lists #advanced](./13-is_palindrome.c, lists.h) 
* CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use.
